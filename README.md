##Distributed Token Exchange

**About**

This is a fully functional Distributed Token Exchange, built with Node, Truffle, and Solidity. The exchange supports the ERC20 Compliant tokens, specifically it trades a fictitous ERC20 token named "MITRA". It supports dynamic admin addition of new tradeable-tokens. The exchange supports buy-in/out and conversion-in/out of ETH in the exchange.

**TODO**
- Extend Lineage tracking and analytics, 
- predicted volume drains,
- Fraud trades (RESNET pipelines for transactions)
- And, better Readme
